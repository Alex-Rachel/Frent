# Unity

Frent supports unity through the [Frent.Unity](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Frent.Unity) package.

The package can be installed manually or with tools such as `NuGetForUnity`. If installing manually, make sure to tag the `Frent.Generator.dll` file with `RoslynAnalyzer`. More information about source generation in Unity can be found in the Unity documentation.
